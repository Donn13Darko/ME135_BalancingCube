## Overview
For this project we will be replicating the [Cubli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y) which is a self-balancing cube.

## Design Challenges
- Quick spin up of flywheels for balancing accompanied with quick stops when trying to move or hop up on an edge.
- Stability: Once up, need to have tight control loops to keep visibly stable without much woble. Also need to account for external forces and react quickly to changes in the environment (pushes, tilting bottom plate, etc. etc.)
